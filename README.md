I created this application to have an easy way to keep up with weekly tasks. To use it, you simply need to take the following steps

1.) install the gemfile by typing the below command in your terminal:
    bundle install 

2.) run the migrations by pasting this in the terminal:
  rails db:migrate

3.) start the rails server with this command:
  rails s

4.) start the react server with:
  npm start --prefix client

5.) once the application is open in the browser, you will need to sign up by creating a unique username and password, then login with those credentials.
